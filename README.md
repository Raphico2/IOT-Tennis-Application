The project is a tennis performance analysis and profiling applicaDon. The applicaDon is connected to a Bluetooth-enabled device that aNaches to the tennis racket. This device sends real-Dme data, allowing the applicaDon to collect a wide range of informaDon for performance analysis. The device provides users with insights into their consistency, ball speed, and the variety of different shots they execute, as well as helps them idenDfy their closest player profile. AddiDonally, the applicaDon allows for analyzing the user's running technique simultaneously.
Furthermore, the same device can be placed in the user's pocket, providing data to the applicaDon for collecDng informaDon about their running acDvity, such as step count, running versus walking detecDon, speed, and distance covered. It also offers insights into the user's running profile. The applicaDon is user-friendly and compaDble with all Android smartphones, ensuring accessibility to a wide range of users.
Overall, the project aims to provide tennis players and runners with a comprehensive analysis of their performance and profiles. The combinaDon of real-Dme data collecDon and user-friendly features makes the applicaDon a valuable tool for enhancing performance and understanding individual strengths and areas for improvement.
